    <string name="text">In June 2014, Google announced Android One, a set of "hardware reference models" that would "allow [device makers] to easily create high-quality phones at low costs", designed for consumers in developing countries.[53][54][55] In September, Google announced the first set of Android One phones for release in India.[56][57] However, Recode reported in June 2015 that the project was "a disappointment", citing "reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners" and "misfires from the search company that has never quite cracked hardware".[58] Plans to relaunch Android One surfaced in August 2015,[59] with Africa announced as the next location for the program a week later.[60][61] A report from The Information in January 2017 stated that Google is expanding its low-cost Android One program into the United States, although The Verge notes that the company will presumably not produce the actual devices itself.[62][63] Google introduced the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones in October 2016, marketed as being the first phones made by Google,[64][65] and exclusively featured certain software features, such as the Google Assistant, before wider rollout.[66][67] The Pixel phones replaced the Nexus series,[68] with a new generation of Pixel phones launched in October 2017.[69]</string>
